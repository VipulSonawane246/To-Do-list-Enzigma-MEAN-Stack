MEAN Stack To-Do List Application
Overview
I built a To-Do List application using the MEAN stack. MEAN stands for MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js, which are the core technologies used to create this app. 
Technologies Used
MongoDB: A NoSQL database to store the tasks.
Express.js: A framework for Node.js to handle server-side logic and communication.
Angular: A front-end framework to build the user interface.
Node.js: A JavaScript runtime used for the server-side part of the application.
What I Did
Project Setup
Server-Side: Set up the server using Node.js and Express.js to handle requests.
Database: Used MongoDB to store the tasks and manage the data.
API Endpoints
GET /api/tasks: Retrieves all tasks.
POST /api/task**: Adds a new task.
PUT /api/task/:id: Updates an existing task by its ID.
DELETE /api/task/:id: Deletes a task by its ID.
 Front-End
 Framework: Built the front-end with Angular.
 Components:  Task List**: Shows all tasks. 
 Task Form: Form for creating and updating tasks.
Services
Task Service: Manages API calls between the front-end and back-end.
Features
Add Task: Users can create new tasks.
View Task: Users can see the list of tasks.Edit Task: Users can update existing tasks.
Delete Task: Users can remove tasks.

#esting
Unit Tests: Wrote tests to check that both the server and front-end code work correctly.
Documentation: Used Postman to document the API.
Wireframes
I followed wireframes to design the UI. These included screens for viewing tasks, adding new tasks, editing tasks, and confirming task deletions.
